**dua** (-> _Disk Usage Analyzer_) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible.

### Installation
#### Cargo
Via `cargo`, which can be obtained using [rustup][rustup]

```
cargo install dua-cli
```
#### VoidLinux
Via `xbps` on your VoidLinux system.

```
xbps-install dua-cli
```

### Usage

```bash
# count the space used in the current working directory
dua
# count the space used in all directories that are not hidden
dua *
# learn about additional functionality
dua aggregate --help
```

### Interactive Mode

Launch into interactive mode with the `i` or `interactive` subcommand. Get help on keyboard
shortcuts with `?`.
Use this mode to explore, and/or to delete files and directories to release disk space.

Please note that great care has been taken to prevent accidential deletions due to a multi-stage
process, which makes this mode viable for exploration.

```bash
dua i
dua interactive
```

### Roadmap

#### ðŸš§v2.2  - Various features and fixes as they come up while people are using it

##### Other Features

 * [ ] Evaluate unit coloring - can we highlight different units better, make them stick out?
 
#### âœ… v2.1.2 bug fixes and improvements

* Performance fix when showing folders with large amounts of files
* Display of amount of entries per directory

#### âœ… v2.1.1 bug fixes and improvements

* Better information about deletion progress
* removal of windows support

#### âœ… v2.1.0- bug fixes and improvements

* windows support (never actually worked), usage of crossterm is difficult thanks to completely
  different input handling.
* additional key-bindings
* auto-restore previous selection in each visited directory

#### âœ… v2.0.1- bug fixes and improvements

* fix typo in title 
* better display of IO-Errors in aggregate mode

#### âœ… v2.0.0 - interactive visualization of directory sizes with an option to queue their deletion

A sub-command bringing up a terminal user interface to allow drilling into directories, and clearing them out, all using the keyboard exclusively.

##### Other Features

 * [x] Single Unit Mode, see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bvjtan/introducing_dua_a_parallel_du_for_humans/epsroxg/)

#### âœ…v1.2 (_released_) - - the first usable, read-only interactive terminal user interface

That's that. We also use `tui-react`, something that makes it much more pleasant to handle the
application and GUI state.

#### âœ…v1.0 (_released_) - aggregate directories, fast

Simple CLI to list top-level directories similar to sn-sort, but faster and more tailored to getting an idea of where most space is used.

### Development

#### Run tests

```bash
make tests
```

#### Learn about other targets

```
make
```

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [jwalk][jwalk], all there was left to do is to write a command-line interface. As `jwalk` matures, **dua** should benefit instantly.

### Limitations

* Interactive mode only looks good in dark terminals (see [this issue](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/13))
* _Hard links_ are not understood, thus hard-linked files will possibly be counted multiple times.
* _Symlinks_ are followed and we obtain the logical size of the file they point to. Ideally, we only
  count their actual size.
* _logical filesize_ is used instead of computed or estimating actual size on disk.
* _easy fix_: file names in main window are not truncated if too large. They are cut off on the right.
* There are plenty of examples in `tests/fixtures` which don't render correctly in interactive mode.
  This can be due to graphemes not interpreted correctly. With Chinese characters for instance,
  column sizes are not correctly computed, leading to certain columns not being shown.
  In other cases, the terminal gets things wrong - I use alacritty, and with certain characaters it
  performs worse than, say iTerm3.
  See https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/blob/master/blns.txt for the source.
* One cannot abort the filesystem traversal
 * as we are in raw terminal mode, signals will not be sent to us. As as we are single-threaded in
   the GUI, we can not listen to input events while traversing the filesystem. This can be solved,
   of course, and I would love the solution to use async :).
* In interactive mode, you will need about 60MB of memory for 1 million entries in the graph.
* In interactive mode, the maximum amount of files is limited to 2^32 - 1 (`u32::max_value() - 1`) entries.
  * One node is used as to 'virtual' root
  * The actual amount of nodes stored might be lower, as there might be more edges than nodes, which are also limited by a `u32` (I guess)
  * The limitation is imposed by the underlying [`petgraph`][petgraph] crate, which declares it as `unsafe` to use u64 for instance.
  * It's possibly *UB* when that limit is reached, however, it was never observed either.
* Dedication to `termion`
  * we use [`termion`][termion] exlusively, and even though [`tui`][tui] supports multiple backends, we only support its termion backend. _Reason_: `tui` is only used for parts of the program, and in all other parts `termion` is used for coloring the output. Thus we wouldn't support changing to a different backend anyway unless everything is done with TUI, which is really not what it is made for.
